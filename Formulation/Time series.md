Time series: random data plus trend, with best-fit line and different applied filters

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **time series** is a series of [data points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point "Data point") indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of [discrete-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time "Discrete-time") data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides "Tides"), counts of [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspots "Sunspots"), and the daily closing value of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average "Dow Jones Industrial Average").

A Time series is very frequently plotted via a [run chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_chart "Run chart") (which is a temporal [line chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart "Line chart")). Time series are used in [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "Signal processing"), [pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition "Pattern recognition"), [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics"), [mathematical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance "Mathematical finance"), [weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting"), [earthquake prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_prediction "Earthquake prediction"), [electroencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography "Electroencephalography"), [control engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering "Control engineering"), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [communications engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_engineering "Communications engineering"), and largely in any domain of applied [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") which involves [temporal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") measurements.

**Time series _analysis_** comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. **Time series _forecasting_** is the use of a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract) "Model (abstract)") to predict future values based on previously observed values. While [regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis "Regression analysis") is often employed in such a way as to test relationships between one or more different time series, this type of analysis is not usually called "time series analysis", which refers in particular to relationships between different points in time within a single series. [Interrupted time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupted_time_series "Interrupted time series") analysis is used to detect changes in the evolution of a time series from before to after some intervention which may affect the underlying variable.

Time series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series analysis distinct from [cross-sectional studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study "Cross-sectional study"), in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order). Time series analysis is also distinct from [spatial data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_data_analysis "Spatial data analysis") where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic "Stochastic") model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see [time reversibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_reversibility "Time reversibility")).

Time series analysis can be applied to [real-valued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), continuous data, [discrete](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/discrete "wikt:discrete") [numeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type#Numeric_types "Data type") data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language")[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-1)).

## Methods for analysis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Methods for analysis")\]

Methods for time series analysis may be divided into two classes: [frequency-domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-domain "Frequency-domain") methods and [time-domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-domain "Time-domain") methods. The former include [spectral analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_spectrum#Spectrum_analysis "Frequency spectrum") and [wavelet analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_analysis "Wavelet analysis"); the latter include [auto-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-correlation "Auto-correlation") and [cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation "Cross-correlation") analysis. In the time domain, correlation and analysis can be made in a filter-like manner using [scaled correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_correlation "Scaled correlation"), thereby mitigating the need to operate in the frequency domain.

Additionally, time series analysis techniques may be divided into [parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_estimation "Parametric estimation") and [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics "Non-parametric statistics") methods. The [parametric approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_estimation "Parametric estimation") assume that the underlying [stationary stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process "Stationary process") has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an [autoregressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive "Autoregressive") or [moving average model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_model "Moving average model")). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, [non-parametric approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics "Non-parametric statistics") explicitly estimate the [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance "Covariance") or the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum") of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure.

Methods of time series analysis may also be divided into [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression "Linear regression") and [non-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression "Nonlinear regression"), and [univariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis "Univariate analysis") and [multivariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis "Multivariate analysis").

## Panel data\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Panel data")\]

A time series is one type of [panel data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data "Panel data"). Panel data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a one-dimensional panel (as is a [cross-sectional dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_data "Cross-sectional data")). A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data. One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records. If the answer is the time data field, then this is a time series data set candidate. If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (e.g. student ID, stock symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate. If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate.

## Analysis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Analysis")\]

There are several types of motivation and data analysis available for time series which are appropriate for different purposes.

### Motivation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Motivation")\]

In the context of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics"), [quantitative finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_finance "Quantitative finance"), [seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology "Seismology"), [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), and [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics") the primary goal of time series analysis is [forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting "Forecasting"). In the context of [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "Signal processing"), [control engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering "Control engineering") and [communication engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_engineering "Communication engineering") it is used for signal detection. Other applications are in [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining "Data mining"), [pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition "Pattern recognition") and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), where time series analysis can be used for [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis "Cluster analysis"),[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-3) [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification "Statistical classification"),[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-4) query by content,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-5) [anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection "Anomaly detection") as well as [forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting "Forecasting").[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-6)

### Exploratory analysis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Exploratory analysis")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Tuberculosis_incidence_US_1953-2009.png/220px-Tuberculosis_incidence_US_1953-2009.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tuberculosis_incidence_US_1953-2009.png)

Tuberculosis incidence US 1953-2009

A straightforward way to examine a regular time series is manually with a [line chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart "Line chart"). An example chart is shown on the right for tuberculosis incidence in the United States, made with a spreadsheet program. The number of cases was standardized to a rate per 100,000 and the percent change per year in this rate was calculated. The nearly steadily dropping line shows that the TB incidence was decreasing in most years, but the percent change in this rate varied by as much as +/- 10%, with 'surges' in 1975 and around the early 1990s. The use of both vertical axes allows the comparison of two time series in one graphic.

A study of corporate data analysts found two challenges to exploratory time series analysis: discovering the shape of interesting patterns, and finding an explanation for these patterns.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-7) Visual tools that represent time series data as [heat map matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map "Heat map") can help overcome these challenges.

Other techniques include:

-   [Autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation "Autocorrelation") analysis to examine [serial dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_dependence "Serial dependence")
-   [Spectral analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_spectrum#Spectrum_analysis "Frequency spectrum") to examine cyclic behavior which need not be related to [seasonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality "Seasonality"). For example, sunspot activity varies over 11 year cycles.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-9) Other common examples include celestial phenomena, weather patterns, neural activity, commodity prices, and economic activity.
-   Separation into components representing trend, seasonality, slow and fast variation, and cyclical irregularity: see [trend estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_estimation "Trend estimation") and [decomposition of time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_time_series "Decomposition of time series")

### Curve fitting\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Curve fitting")\]

Curve fitting[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-11) is the process of constructing a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"), or [mathematical function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), that has the best fit to a series of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") points,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-12) possibly subject to constraints.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-14) Curve fitting can involve either [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation"),[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-15)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-16) where an exact fit to the data is required, or [smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing "Smoothing"),[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-18) in which a "smooth" function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is [regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis "Regression analysis"),[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-20) which focuses more on questions of [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference "Statistical inference") such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization,[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-22) to infer values of a function where no data are available,[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-23) and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-24) [Extrapolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation "Extrapolation") refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics) "Range (statistics)") of the observed data,[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-25) and is subject to a [degree of uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty")[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-26) since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.

The construction of economic time series involves the estimation of some components for some dates by [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation") between values ("benchmarks") for earlier and later dates. Interpolation is estimation of an unknown quantity between two known quantities (historical data), or drawing conclusions about missing information from the available information ("reading between the lines").[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-27) Interpolation is useful where the data surrounding the missing data is available and its trend, seasonality, and longer-term cycles are known. This is often done by using a related series known for all relevant dates.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-28) Alternatively [polynomial interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation "Polynomial interpolation") or [spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation "Spline interpolation") is used where piecewise [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") functions are fit into time intervals such that they fit smoothly together. A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function (also called [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression "Polynomial regression")).The main difference between regression and interpolation is that polynomial regression gives a single polynomial that models the entire data set. Spline interpolation, however, yield a piecewise continuous function composed of many polynomials to model the data set.

[Extrapolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation "Extrapolation") is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation"), which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty") and a higher risk of producing meaningless results.

### Function approximation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Function approximation")\]

In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") among a well-defined class that closely matches ("approximates") a target function in a task-specific way. One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions, [approximation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_theory "Approximation theory") is the branch of [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis") that investigates how certain known functions (for example, [special functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_function "Special function")) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") or [rational functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function "Rational function")) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).

Second, the target function, call it _g_, may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points (a time series) of the form (_x_, _g_(_x_)) is provided. Depending on the structure of the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") and [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain") of _g_, several techniques for approximating _g_ may be applicable. For example, if _g_ is an operation on the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), techniques of [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation"), [extrapolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation "Extrapolation"), [regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis "Regression analysis"), and [curve fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting "Curve fitting") can be used. If the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain") (range or target set) of _g_ is a finite set, one is dealing with a [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification "Statistical classification") problem instead. A related problem of _online_ time series approximation[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-29) is to summarize the data in one-pass and construct an approximate representation that can support a variety of time series queries with bounds on worst-case error.

To some extent, the different problems ([regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis "Regression analysis"), [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification "Statistical classification"), [fitness approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_approximation "Fitness approximation")) have received a unified treatment in [statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory "Statistical learning theory"), where they are viewed as [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning "Supervised learning") problems.

### Prediction and forecasting\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Prediction and forecasting")\]

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction "Prediction") is a part of [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference "Statistical inference"). One particular approach to such inference is known as [predictive inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference "Predictive inference"), but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting "Forecasting").

-   Fully formed statistical models for [stochastic simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_simulation "Stochastic simulation") purposes, so as to generate alternative versions of the time series, representing what might happen over non-specific time-periods in the future
-   Simple or fully formed statistical models to describe the likely outcome of the time series in the immediate future, given knowledge of the most recent outcomes (forecasting).
-   Forecasting on time series is usually done using automated statistical software packages and programming languages, such as [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language) "Julia (programming language)"), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) "R (programming language)"), [SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software) "SAS (software)"), [SPSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS "SPSS") and many others.
-   Forecasting on large scale data can be done with [Apache Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark "Apache Spark") using the Spark-TS library, a third-party package.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-30)

### Classification\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Classification")\]

Assigning time series pattern to a specific category, for example identify a word based on series of hand movements in [sign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language "Sign language").

### Signal estimation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Signal estimation")\]

This approach is based on [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis") and filtering of signals in the [frequency domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain "Frequency domain") using the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform "Fourier transform"), and [spectral density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density_estimation "Spectral density estimation"), the development of which was significantly accelerated during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") by mathematician [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener "Norbert Wiener"), electrical engineers [Rudolf E. Kálmán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_E._K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n "Rudolf E. Kálmán"), [Dennis Gabor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Gabor "Dennis Gabor") and others for filtering signals from noise and predicting signal values at a certain point in time. See [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter "Kalman filter"), [Estimation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory "Estimation theory"), and [Digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing")

### Segmentation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Segmentation")\]

Splitting a time-series into a sequence of segments. It is often the case that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of individual segments, each with its own characteristic properties. For example, the audio signal from a conference call can be partitioned into pieces corresponding to the times during which each person was speaking. In time-series segmentation, the goal is to identify the segment boundary points in the time-series, and to characterize the dynamical properties associated with each segment. One can approach this problem using [change-point detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_detection "Change detection"), or by modeling the time-series as a more sophisticated system, such as a Markov jump linear system.

## Models\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Models")\]

Models for time series data can have many forms and represent different [stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes "Stochastic processes"). When modeling variations in the level of a process, three broad classes of practical importance are the _[autoregressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive "Autoregressive")_ (AR) models, the _integrated_ (I) models, and the _[moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_model "Moving average model")_ (MA) models. These three classes depend linearly on previous data points.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-linear_time_series-31) Combinations of these ideas produce [autoregressive moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_moving_average "Autoregressive moving average") (ARMA) and [autoregressive integrated moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average "Autoregressive integrated moving average") (ARIMA) models. The [autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average "Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average") (ARFIMA) model generalizes the former three. Extensions of these classes to deal with vector-valued data are available under the heading of multivariate time-series models and sometimes the preceding acronyms are extended by including an initial "V" for "vector", as in VAR for [vector autoregression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression "Vector autoregression"). An additional set of extensions of these models is available for use where the observed time-series is driven by some "forcing" time-series (which may not have a causal effect on the observed series): the distinction from the multivariate case is that the forcing series may be deterministic or under the experimenter's control. For these models, the acronyms are extended with a final "X" for "exogenous".

Non-linear dependence of the level of a series on previous data points is of interest, partly because of the possibility of producing a [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") time series. However, more importantly, empirical investigations can indicate the advantage of using predictions derived from non-linear models, over those from linear models, as for example in [nonlinear autoregressive exogenous models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_autoregressive_exogenous_model "Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model"). Further references on nonlinear time series analysis: (Kantz and Schreiber),[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-32) and (Abarbanel)[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-33)

Among other types of non-linear time series models, there are models to represent the changes of variance over time ([heteroskedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroskedasticity "Heteroskedasticity")). These models represent [autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity "Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity") (ARCH) and the collection comprises a wide variety of representation ([GARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GARCH "GARCH"), TARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, CGARCH, etc.). Here changes in variability are related to, or predicted by, recent past values of the observed series. This is in contrast to other possible representations of locally varying variability, where the variability might be modelled as being driven by a separate time-varying process, as in a [doubly stochastic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_model "Doubly stochastic model").

In recent work on model-free analyses, wavelet transform based methods (for example locally stationary wavelets and wavelet decomposed neural networks) have gained favor. Multiscale (often referred to as multiresolution) techniques decompose a given time series, attempting to illustrate time dependence at multiple scales. See also [Markov switching multifractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_switching_multifractal "Markov switching multifractal") (MSMF) techniques for modeling volatility evolution.

A [Hidden Markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model "Hidden Markov model") (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can be considered as the simplest [dynamic Bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Bayesian_network "Dynamic Bayesian network"). HMM models are widely used in [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition"), for translating a time series of spoken words into text.

### Notation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Notation")\]

A number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis. A common notation specifying a time series _X_ that is indexed by the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") is written

_X_ = (_X_1, _X_2, ...).

Another common notation is

_Y_ = (_Yt_: _t_ ∈ _T_),

where _T_ is the [index set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_set "Index set").

### Conditions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Conditions")\]

There are two sets of conditions under which much of the theory is built:

-   [Stationary process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process "Stationary process")
-   [Ergodic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_process "Ergodic process")

However, ideas of stationarity must be expanded to consider two important ideas: [strict stationarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_stationarity "Strict stationarity") and [second-order stationarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process#Weaker_forms_of_stationarity "Stationary process"). Both models and applications can be developed under each of these conditions, although the models in the latter case might be considered as only partly specified.

In addition, time-series analysis can be applied where the series are [seasonally stationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclostationary_process "Cyclostationary process") or non-stationary. Situations where the amplitudes of frequency components change with time can be dealt with in [time-frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-frequency_analysis "Time-frequency analysis") which makes use of a [time–frequency representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93frequency_representation "Time–frequency representation") of a time-series or signal.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-34)

### Tools\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Tools")\]

Tools for investigating time-series data include:

-   Consideration of the [autocorrelation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation "Autocorrelation") and the [spectral density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density "Spectral density") (also [cross-correlation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation_function "Cross-correlation function") and cross-spectral density functions)
-   [Scaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_correlation "Scaled correlation") cross- and auto-correlation functions to remove contributions of slow components[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-Nikolicetal-35)

## Visualization\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Visualization")\]

Time series can be visualized with two categories of chart: Overlapping Charts and Separated Charts. Overlapping Charts display all-time series on the same layout while Separated Charts presents them on different layouts (but aligned for comparison purpose)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#cite_note-42)
